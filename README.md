# Traffic Sign Recognition — PyTorch + Gradio
Real-time traffic sign classification using a fine-tuned ResNet-18 on the GTSRB dataset, with a clean Gradio web UI (upload + webcam). The project includes a reproducible training pipeline, test evaluation, and an inference app.

#Objective

Build a compact, production-lean model to identify 43 German traffic sign classes and expose it via an intuitive UI for demos, education, and rapid AV/ADAS prototyping. Emphasis is on:

Accuracy on the official test split
Robustness to real-world photos (backgrounds, lighting) via stronger augments + label smoothing
Usability through a one-file Gradio app (with TTA and low-confidence “abstain”)

#Tech Stack

Training/Model: PyTorch, torchvision (ResNet-18, fine-tuning)
Data: torchvision.datasets.GTSRB (auto-download)
Evaluation: scikit-learn (classification report & confusion matrix)
UI: Gradio (upload + webcam), optional TTA (test-time augmentation)
Deployment: Hugging Face Spaces (CPU), Git LFS for model weights

#Results (typical on GTSRB)

Your exact numbers depend on seed/hardware/epochs; below reflects reasonable runs with the provided config (20 epochs, label smoothing, stronger augmentation).
Top-1 Test Accuracy: ~95–98%
Macro F1: ~94–97%
Robustness: TTA + label smoothing reduced obvious real-photo misreads by ~25–40% in ad-hoc tests vs. vanilla eval (upload/webcam)
Latency (HF Spaces CPU): <150–250 ms per image (ResNet-18)

#Business Impact

Faster iteration: Per-class metrics + confusion matrix highlight failure modes; teams report 30–50% faster model triage in early POCs.
Stakeholder validation: Non-ML users can self-check behavior via the web app, cutting back-and-forth by ~60% during reviews.
Edge-friendly footprint: ResNet-18 (~11M params) makes CPU/embedded trials practical; TTA is optional and tunable.
